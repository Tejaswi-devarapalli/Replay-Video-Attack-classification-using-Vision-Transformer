**About Project**

 A replay attack is the act of replaying a previously filmed original video and claiming it as a genuine one. This type of attack involves an attacker intercepting a video transmission and then replaying it to deceive the recipient into thinking it is a live feed. These attacks involve the unauthorized playback of recorded videos, which can lead to various malicious activities such as identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. The attacker gains unauthorized access or manipulates the system's behavior by replaying the genuine footage. Additionally, identifying and mitigating these attacks helps in maintaining trust in digital platforms and upholding the overall security of online environments. The main goal of this project is to differentiate between real-time videos and manipulated recordings.The approach followed: preprocessing the video data by capturing frames and using vision transformers to identify if the video is genuine or an attack and achieved an accuracy of 94%. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms our baseline model that extracts features from a 1D CNN network and classifies using SVM, in terms of f1-score, precision, recall, accuracy.
